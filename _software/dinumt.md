description: This software is designed to identify and genotype nuclear insertions of mitochondrial origin from whole genome sequence data. It consists of two programs, diumt (di-nu-mite), which identifies sites of insertions in a single sample and gnomit (geno-mite), which genotypes those sites across multiple samples.
