description: This software is designed to identify regions of active translation from ribsome profiling sequence data. This analytical pipeline scores the translational status of each annotated region (5'UTR, CDS, exon, 3'UTR) as a function of its spectral coherence over user-defined N nucleotide sliding windows to an idealized reference coding signal.
