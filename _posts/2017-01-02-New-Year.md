As the New Year has come, we bid a fond farewell - with delicious cake! - to Alex Weber as she continues with her first year as a Ph.D. student in DCMB. We welcomed two new students to the Mills Lab this semester - with even more delicious cake! - Catherine Barnier, and Zhenning Zhang. Catherine Barnier is a first year Ph.D. student in the PIBS program who will be joining the Mills Lab for a research rotation, and Zhenning Zhang is a Masters student in the Bioinformatics department. In addition, Nan Lin, a Masters student in the Department of Human Genetics, has re-joined the lab to continue his research for a second semester. We are excited for 2017, and look forward to many successful grants and published papers. And cake.
