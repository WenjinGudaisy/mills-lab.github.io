The Mills Lab is happy to welcome Chen Sun as he will be joining the lab for his Ph.D. After having completed rotations in the labs of Dr. Jun Li, and Dr. Yuanfang Guan, Chen will be expected to publish at least 28 highly regarded papers in multiple high-impact journals with at least 20,000 citations by the time he graduates. Likely before Yifan.
